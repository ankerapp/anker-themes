### How to use this theme
This applies to all themes in `anker-themes` repository. To use the theme you
can either download the theme file manually which is `_hacktoberfest.scss` and

directory to be compiled.

The other solution is to navigate to `themes/` directory and use cURL to export
it directly from this repository like following:
